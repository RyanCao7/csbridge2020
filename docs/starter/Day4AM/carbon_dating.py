File: carbon_dating.py
-------------------
This program runs carbon dating (how cool!)
First, it prints out a lookup table that maps the percent
of c14 remaining to the number of years the sample has been
dead for, for the first 20 half lives.

Then, it prompts the user to enter a percent of c14, and it
will output the age of that sample.  It will reprompt the user
until they enter -1, at which point the program will terminate.
