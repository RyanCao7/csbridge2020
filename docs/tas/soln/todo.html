    <p>Teaching tips:
      <ol>
        <li>Learning goal: if statements, loops and decomposition
        <li>Milestone: Paint one row
        <li>Encourage students to think about what high level commands might be useful for Karel to know to solve the problem.  Then implement those using lower-level Karel commands.
        <li>The hardest part is looping between rows, and approaching a larger program.
      </ol>
