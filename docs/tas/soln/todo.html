      <p>Problem: <a href="../../en/projects/efes.html">Charles Bridge</a></p>
      <p>Teaching tips:
        <ol>
          <li>Learning goal: For loops and decomposition
          <li>Milestone: build a single column.
          <li>Write code on the board. Start with pseudocode, turn to real code
          <li>Encourage students to work in pairs to program out the milestones.
          <li>The hardest part is the fence-post bug when building a col.
