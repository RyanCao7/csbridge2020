		The Idea of the Course
	</h2>

	<p>The point of this two week course is to teach you the fundamentals of computer programming to the point where you can go and learn on your own. It is taught by a collaboration of instructors from Stanford University and CTU. You will learn to program using material for Stanford's Introduction to Computer Science course.</p>
