solution: soln.py

Write a program that lets the user add random ovals and rectangles to the canvas with a specified color.  Specifically, it should have a toolbar at the top of the window with a text field to enter a color, and two buttons: one to create an oval of that color, and one to create a rectangle of that color.  Clicking one of those buttons should create that shape with the typed-in color with a random location and size.
