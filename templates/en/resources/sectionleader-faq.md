### What will **lectures** look like? 
Lectures will be held twice a day - there will be one 30 minute lecture at the start of the day and one 30 minute lecture in the evening. The morning lectures will be taught by a lecturer from either Koç University or Czech Technical University and the evening lecture will be taught by a lecturer from Stanford University. This is where students will learn the core concepts of the class.

* Lectures will be delivered LIVE through Zoom and will be recorded and posted on Ed so students can refer back to them later if they need to.

### What is **quickstart**?
This can be thought of as supervised work time. It will occur in Zoom but can be thought of as work time and not teaching time. It is a time in which students will be working individually on a "quickstart" problem.

### What is **tea time**? 
This is an opportunity for you to get to know a small group of students better. You can do some ice breakers as a form of social time or you can have discussions about cs. Due to the time difference, the Koç and CTU SLs will run these sessions so the Stanford SLs' students will be distributed among the Koç and CTU SLs. 

### What will the **office hours/work** block look?
These office hours will be help sessions with opportunities for small breakout sessions over Zoom. Ten Koç and CTU SLs will be assigned to run each morning office hour session and all of the Stanford SLs plus 5 Koc/CTU SLs will be assigned the evening sessions. We are not expecting students to have to spend time working on the course outside of the scheduled blocks which is why this time is also titled “work”. If students don’t need individual help, they’ll just work on the projects on their own. Office hours are an opportunity for students to work on the assignments and if they need help, there will be SLs there in the Zoom who can help them. There will be a system for students to submit the code they need help with when they sign up for the office hours so that you can see their code and help them in a breakout room. There will be one or two SLs hosting the Zoom office hour session who will pair off SLs and students into breakout rooms for individual help.

### What is the difference between **morning submit** and **evening submit**? 
Students will be submitting two projects per day - once for the project they've been working in the morning (morning submit) and once in the evening for the project they've been working in the second half of the day (evening submit). Submissions will be made directly to Ed. 

### Why is there a **free play** and a **dinner** block?  
We wanted to make sure that it's clear to students when they will be working on CS Bridge activities and when they are not expected to be at their computer working on the program. Free play and dinner are unstructured time blocks with **NO CS Bridge activities**. Students should take a huge break during this time (step away from the computer and be kids).
We've blocked out time for dinner 5-7pm (CZ) and 6-8pm (TU) so that students, families, SLs can make sure to have dinner before the evening activities begin. Lunch isn't labeled in the schedule but it'd be after 12:30 (CZ) and after 1:30 (TU).

### What will happen in the **SL team meeting**?
This meeting will be lead by the Lecturers and is a time for ALL SLs to meet (via Zoom) to share feedback and to focus on different aspects of the program. It is also an opportunity for SL training.

### What will **section** look like? 

## General Questions###

### If I have feedback about the program or content I'd like to discuss in the SL team meeting, who should I tell and how?
There is a **Reflection** category in the Ed Section Leader group. Once the program starts, you'll find a link to a Google Doc with a reflection form you can fill out on a daily basis. This form will help you reflect on your own teaching experience and will help the lecturers get a pulse on how things are going. Feedback and reflection are essential for making improvements. We want this to be the best it can be for everyone!
