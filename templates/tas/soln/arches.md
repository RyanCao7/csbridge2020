problemtitle: Build Arches

The problem below is the section problem for the day.  Here is information about the goals for the problem and what you should focus on during section:

**Learning Goal**: `for` loops and decomposition

**Milestone**: build a single column

Write code on the board. Start with pseudocode, turn to real code.  Encourage students to work in pairs to program out the milestones.  The hardest part is the fence-post bug when building a col, and when putting beepers in a column.
