problemTitle: Making Tracks

The problem below is the first project for the day.  It is very similar to the lecture examples and meant as a warmup with mouse interactions.  They will need to use the standard pattern of looping and checking each time for new mouse clicks, and acting on each of those clicks.  In this case, the action will be to add an image at that mouse click location.
