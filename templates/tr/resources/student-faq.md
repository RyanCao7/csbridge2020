No, this is purely for the joy of learning!

We donâ€™t promise a certificate of completion. This class is purely for the joy of learning! We are talking to folks to see what is possible and it seems very reasonable that we could help you share that you participated in this experience :-)

Have fun with it. Do the readings. Come to section. Download PyCharm and do the assignments. Learn from your community on Ed.
